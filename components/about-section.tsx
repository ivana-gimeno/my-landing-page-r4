            <p>
              I'm a freelance product strategist based in Montreal with 10+ years turning complexity into clarity. I've
              led teams through full platform migrations, payment overhauls, and supply chain transformationsâ€”the kind
              of work that touches every corner of a business. I thrive on making the ambiguous actionable and getting
              stakeholders aligned when it matters most.
            </p>

            <p>
              I bring a bias for action and a track record of driving real outcomes: streamlined operations, faster
              time-to-market, and products that actually solve problems. Whether you're navigating a critical pivot or
              building something from scratch, I'm here to help you move forward with confidence and momentum.
